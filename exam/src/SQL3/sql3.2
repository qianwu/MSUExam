1. There are functional dependencies in this table, so first, normalize the relation/table to the second normal
form (2NF). Please show the resulting table(s) after the normalization.
2. Using the table(s) in 2NF, write a query to display the total vacation days per year for each employee, sorted
by employee name and year.

Q1:  Employee ID → Employee Name, Department:

     Each Employee ID uniquely determines the Employee Name and Department.
     This indicates a partial dependency, as Employee Name and Department depend only on Employee ID and not on the composite key.
     (Employee ID, Year) → Vacation Days:

     The combination of Employee ID and Year determines the number of vacation days taken.
     This is a full dependency, as both Employee ID and Year are needed to uniquely identify the vacation days.

Q2: Using the table(s) in 2NF, write a query to display the total vacation days per year for each employee, sorted
    by employee name and year.

    table 1:employee ; table 2: vocation
    select e.EmployeeName, v.Year, SUM(v.TotalVacationDays) As TotalVacationDays from employee e JOIN vocation v on e.EmployeeID = v.EmployeeID GROUP BY e.EmployeeName, v.Year ORDER BY e.EmployeeName, v.Year;
